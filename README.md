This project involves using machine learning with weather data to predict how well an area is suited for solar power generation. Several variables are tested for correlations to solar intensity, which in turn correlates to how much solar power can be obtained in the area.

The report can be found in the markdown sections of the code file. It explains our process, how we obtained our results, and our conclusions.

For future endeavors, we believe further intensive processing of the data set and extracting poor fitting samples would greatly help our model. We tried to correlate other variables such as surface albedo and wind speed, but to no avail. Perhaps a different method such as SVM could do a better job with the data set.
