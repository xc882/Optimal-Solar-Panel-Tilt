This project involves using machine learning with weather data to predict how well an area is suited for solar power generation. Several variables are tested for correlations to solar intensity, which in turn correlates to how much solar power can be obtained in the area.

The report can be found in the markdown sections of the code file. It explains our process, how we obtained our results, and our conclusions.
